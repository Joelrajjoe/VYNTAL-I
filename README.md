# VYNTAL-I
VYNTAL-I is an autonomous multi-agent intelligence engine that transforms natural-language queries into real-time, actionable data insights.

VYNTAL-I transforms natural language questions into instant, accurate data insights. No SQL or Python knowledge required—just ask your questions in plain English and let specialized AI agents handle the rest.
Built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and powered by Gemini 2.0, VYNTAL-I orchestrates multiple specialized agents that work together like an analytics team:

🔍 SQL Agent - Generates and executes optimized SQL queries
🐼 Pandas Agent - Performs complex Python-based data analysis
🌐 Search Agent - Retrieves real-time external insights via Google Search

💡 Why VYNTAL-I?
The Problem

Barrier to entry: Most people lack SQL/Python expertise
Slow workflows: Analysts spend hours writing and debugging queries
Tool fragmentation: Constant switching between querying, analyzing, and visualizing
Bottlenecks: Non-technical users depend entirely on data teams
Stale insights: External/real-time data requires manual searching

The Solution
VYNTAL-I provides a unified, intelligent, and automated analytics system that:

✅ Accepts natural language queries
✅ Automatically routes to the right specialist agent
✅ Executes queries and analysis
✅ Generates visualizations
✅ Provides actionable insights in seconds
